EEPROMAnything is a fork of a poplar arduino EEPROM library. 
tis only reason for exsistence is to wrap the string handler which had issues ( In my experience) of getting the string lengths wrong.
Clone to your arduino library folder and klet it get pulled into the ESP8266 ASCOM projects in the1 repository.
